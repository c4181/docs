# Updating xPilot
Every time you start xPilot, it automatically checks for updates. If a new version is available, you will receive a prompt to download and install it.

**<span style="color:red;">X-Plane MUST be closed before installing an xPilot update.</span>**

If you choose to click <span class="gray-btn">No</span>, you will be reminded about the update the next time you launch xPilot.

Clicking <span class="blue-btn">Yes</span> will initiate the download process. Once the download is complete, xPilot will automatically close, and the installer will open. On macOS, a disk image will be mounted, and a Finder window will appear with the installer that needs to be launched.
