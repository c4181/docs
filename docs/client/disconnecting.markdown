# Disconnecting
When you wish to disconnect from VATSIM, simply click on the <span class="blue-btn">DISCONNECT</span> button in the xPilot client. This will initiate the disconnection process.

Additionally, xPilot will automatically disconnect you from the network in the following situations:
- Shutting down the flight simulator
- Switching airports within the flight simulator
- Loading a different flight or scenario in the flight simulator

Upon disconnection, the controller list will be cleared, and all aircraft models associated with VATSIM will be removed from the simulator environment.
