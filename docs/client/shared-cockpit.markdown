# Shared Cockpit (Observer) Mode
xPilot provides support for observer mode, which allows you to connect to the network without your aircraft being visible to other users. This feature is primarily used for shared cockpit operations. To utilize observer mode, follow these steps:

1. The first pilot should connect to the network as usual using their desired callsign, such as `JBU123`.

2. The second pilot, who wishes to join in observer mode, should append a letter to the end of the callsign used by the first pilot. For example, the second pilot can use `JBU123A`. You can use any letter as a suffix.

By using this approach, the second pilot will be able to connect to the network as an observer without their aircraft being visible to other users.
