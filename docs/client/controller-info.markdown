# Request Controller Info
To obtain the controller information or text ATIS on VATSIM, you can double-click on the controller entry in the controller list. This action will display the controller information in the main message area.

Alternatively, you can use the `.atis` dot command to request the controller information. For more information on dot commands, please refer to the section on [Dot Commands](/docs/client/dot-commands.html).
