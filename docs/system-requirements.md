# System Requirements

* Operating System:
  * **Windows** Microsoft Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit only.
  * **macOS** macOS 10.15 or newer (x64 or Apple Silicon)
  * **Linux** 64-bit only. xPilot is built on Ubuntu 20.04; therefore, it should run on any modern Linux distribution.

* [X-Plane 11.50](http://x-plane.com/) (or newer), with suitable graphics hardware.
* CSL Model Set. The [Bluebell OBJ8 CSL Package](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/) is highly recommended.

If in doubt about X-Plane hardware requirements, please check the official [X-Plane 11 System Requirements](http://www.x-plane.com/kb/x-plane-11-system-requirements/).
