# X-Plane Quit Unexpectedly
If X-Plane quits unexpectedly (known as a "Crash to Desktop" or CTD), the last line in the `Log.txt` will usually indicate what caused the application to crash. If xPilot caused X-Plane to crash, the last line in the `Log.txt` will end with `--=={This application has crashed because of the plugin: xPilot}==--`

The `Log.txt` is overwritten each time you restart X-Plane, so it's important to save a copy of it before you restart X-Plane.

X-Plane will also usually create a crash report in `Output/crash_reports`.

It's very important that you include both the crash report and the `Log.txt` when reporting a crash. Without this information, it's impossible to know what caused X-Plane to crash.
