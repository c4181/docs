# Flight Plan
To file flight plans on VATSIM, you need to use the myVATSIM Flight Plan service website. To access this website, simply click the <span class="toolbar-btn">FLIGHT PLAN</span> button in the client. This action will open your default web browser and take you to the myVATSIM flight plan website.

If you haven't already authenticated yourself, you will be prompted to enter your VATSIM credentials, which include your VATSIM ID and Password. Once you have successfully logged in, you can proceed to file your flight plan.
