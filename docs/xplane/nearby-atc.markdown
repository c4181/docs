# Nearby ATC
The Nearby ATC window shows controllers who are within range, organized by facility type; the list includes the callsign, frequency and person's name of the station. There are three action buttons available. The first button will request the station information (controller ATIS) and the second and third button will tune your COM1 or COM2 radio frequency to the controller's frequency.

At the bottom of the Nearby ATC list, there is a dedicated section to tune your COM1 or COM2 radio to the VATSIM UNICOM frequency.
