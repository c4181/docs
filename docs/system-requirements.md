  * **Windows** Microsoft Windows 10, 64-bit only.
  * **MacOS** macOS 10.12 or newer, 64-bit only. Successfully tested with macOS Catalina.
  * **Linux** 64-bit only. xPilot is built on Ubuntu 20.04; therefore, it should run on any modern Linux distribution.

* CSL Model Set. The [Bluebell OBJ8 CSL Package](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/37041-bluebell-obj8-csl-packages/) is highly recommended.
