# Push to Talk
You must configure a Radio Push to Talk (PTT) command binding to communicate with controllers via voice on the network. You can either bind the PTT using a joystick button (recommended) or assign a keyboard key. 

**<span style="color:red;">If you set your PTT to a keyboard key, X-Plane must be the only active and focused window for the PTT keypress to be captured. This means that xPilot (or any other window, like a web browser) cannot be visible and active at the same time. To ensure that X-Plane has focus, mouse click into the X-Plane simulator window to make the window active. X-Plane also limits what keys you can bind to. You cannot bind system modifier keys, like CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, etc.</span>**

To bind your PTT, open the X-Plane settings menu.

The binding is now complete.
